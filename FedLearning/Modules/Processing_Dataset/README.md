### More Detailed Information for MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset from Kaggle is a popular benchmark for handwritten digit recognition. For federated learning, you can use the MNIST dataset to train multiple models on separate devices, and then combine their updates to create a centralized model. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images (28x28 pixels) and 10,000 testing images, with classes 0-9. To use MNIST with federated learning, you'll need to preprocess the data, split it among devices, and implement a federated learning algorithm.

# Multilayer Federated Learning Model

## Introduction
This repository implements a multilayer federated learning model in Python, enabling collaborative machine learning across multiple decentralized devices or clients while maintaining data privacy.

## Model Architecture
The proposed model consists of:

- Multiple layers of neural networks for feature extraction and classification
- Federated averaging algorithm for model aggregation
- Support for various optimization algorithms and loss functions

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.4+
- NumPy 1.20+
- SciPy 1.7+
- Matplotlib 3.4+ (for visualization)

## Installation
bash
cd multilayer-federated-learning
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in CSV or NUMPY format.
2. Configure the model architecture and hyperparameters in config.json.
3. Run Python to start federated training.

## Example Use Cases
- Healthcare: Collaborative disease diagnosis without sharing sensitive patient data.
- Finance: Joint fraud detection across multiple institutions while maintaining data confidentiality.

## Model Evaluation
- global accuracy: 96.333%
- Recall: 99%
- global loss: 1.511637568473816
